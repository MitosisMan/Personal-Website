            My name is Evan Kostov, and I am currently a Junior Computer Science student minoring in Game Design at Texas A&M University in College Station.
            I am a <a href="https://brownfound.org/">Brown Foundation scholar</a> and National Merit Finalist, and I have been programming for 6 years.
            On campus, I am involved as a member of the <a href = "https://tagdigda.wixsite.com/gamedev">Texas A&M Game Developers Club</a>, where I compete to create a game every semester. 
            In this organization, I have learned many skills such as Github, Task Management, and Physics Engines.
            Additionally, I am on the Merch committee for my Organiztion <a href="https://www.aggietansa.com/">TANSA</a>, in which I along with other National Merit scholars work to recruit prospective high schoolers to Texas A&M.
            <br>
            <br>
            Academically, I am a Teaching assistant for the Data Strutures and Algorithms class at A&M, where I work under <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/tleyk.html">Dr Teresa Leyk</a>
            Being a TA has taught me much about not only the content of the course, but also how to lead a team and convey expectations to a large group of technical individuals.
            Separately, I am a <a href = "https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/peer-teachers/index.html">Peer Teacher</a> for the general computer science department. In this role, I help students from every computer science class at A&M with any questions they encounter.
            As part of being a Peer Teacher, I conduct weekly reviews for Discrete Structures and Mathematics to help students in one of the most challenging courses in the program.
            I have participated in several hackathons at Texas A&M, including <a href="https://chillennium.com/">chillennium</a>, <a href="https://tidal-hackathon.devpost.com/">TidalHack</a>, and <a href="https://tamu-datathon.devpost.com/">Datathon</a>.
            A collection of all of my work can be viewed on my <a href="https://github.com/MitosisMan">Github page</a>, or be viewed on the Technical section of this website.
            <br>
            <br>
            This summer, I will be working as a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/">Capital One</a> in Plano, where I will be learning valuable industry skills and working on incredible real-world projects.
            I can't wait to begin, and I know that I will become a much better programmer and person from the experiences I will have there.
